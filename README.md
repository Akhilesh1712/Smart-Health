1 .Enhanced Vision for the Blind: Our application uses image processing to offer audio descriptions of objects, enabling blind individuals to navigate their surroundings confidently.
2. Empowering the Mute: For those who cannot speak, our platform provides speech-to-text and text-to-speech features for seamless communication. Additionally, it detects nearby sounds and notifies users, enhancing situational awareness.
3. Revolutionizing Healthcare Access: We've developed a web-based application that simplifies doctor appointments and stores medical history, making healthcare more accessible and efficient.
4. Seamless Health Monitoring: Our platform integrates with smart devices, providing doctors with vital information for precise diagnoses and prescriptions. We also offer online consultations, healthcare insurance, and affordable medicine options.

Note: Our project is in its final stages, with the remaining 30% involving machine learning models for image processing, sound detection, sound tracking, and safety enhancements currently in training and testing phases.
